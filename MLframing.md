   ###### 1-Translate business challenge into ML use case. Considerations include:

           Defining business problems
           Identifying nonML solutions
           Defining output use
           Managing incorrect results

  ######  2- Define ML problem. Considerations include:

           Defining problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
           Defining outcome of model predictions
           Defining the input (features) and predicted output format
       
  ######  3- Define business success criteria. Considerations include:

           Success metrics
           Key results
