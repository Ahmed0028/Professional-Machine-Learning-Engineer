# Professional Machine Learning Engineer
A Professional Machine Learning Engineer designs, builds, and productionizes ML models to solve business challenges using Google Cloud technologies and knowledge of proven ML models and techniques. The ML Engineer is proficient in all aspects of model architecture, data pipeline interaction, and metrics interpretation and needs familiarity with application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and security.

The Professional Machine Learning Engineer exam assesses your ability to:

- Frame ML problems
- Architect ML solutions
- Prepare and process data
- Develop ML models
- Automate & orchestrate ML pipelines
- Monitor, optimize, and maintain ML solutions


**This repository contains some Resources and Tips that will help you prepare for the Exam** 

**I will follow the same architect exam guide from Google** [Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification Exam Guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/machine-learning-engineer)

## The Main Sections Of The Exams: 

### Section 1: ML Problem Framing:
#### This Section aims to assess your knowledge and understanding of the folloowing topics : 
   
   ###### 1-Translate business challenge into ML use case. Considerations include:

           Defining business problems
           Identifying nonML solutions
           Defining output use
           Managing incorrect results
           Identifying data sources
  ######  2- Define ML problem. Considerations include:

           Defining problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
           Defining outcome of model predictions
           Defining the input (features) and predicted output format
       
  ######  3- Define business success criteria. Considerations include:

           Success metrics
           Key results
           Determination of when a model is deemed unsuccessful
           
 ######   4- Identify risks to feasibility and implementation of ML solution. Considerations include:

           Assessing and communicating business impact
           Assessing ML solution readiness
           Assessing data readiness
           Aligning with Google AI principles and practices (e.g. different biases)
